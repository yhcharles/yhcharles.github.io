# Mount exFAT on Mac

## if you only want to mount your exFAT disk

https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/293390/macos-cant-mount-exfat-external-drive

If your ExFAT drive is not mounting, here is the solution.

```
sudo pkill -f fsck
```

`fsck` was holding the disk hostage. A quick `ps aux | grep fsck` revealed that indeed it was hijacking the disk/volume as soon as it was plugged in. `sudo pkill -f fsck` (or just `kill` with the PID if you prefer) immediately allowed the volume to be mounted.

Then to make the hard drive writable, you have to run the Disk Utility "S.O.S.", unmount then mount it again:

- open "Disk Utility" app
- find your disk on the left sidebar, right click on it, then click "Run First Aid ..."
- wait for it to finish

## the above solution only kills fsck, but you're still unable to write into that disk

- ~~use `disk util` to find the right drive id~~
- ~~remember the id number under IDENTIFIER column, something like `disk2s1`~~
- ~~fix your disk: `sudo fsck_exfat -d <your id>`, e.g. `sudo fsck_exfat -d disk2s1`~~
  - ~~if you get `Can't open /dev/disk2s1: Resource Busy"` error, try to find out and kill the process locking the resource~~
  - ~~`ps -ax | grep disk2s1` to find out process id (pid), and then `sudo kill <pid>`~~
- ~~wait for it to finish~~
