> In macOS, when a key is held down while entering text, a popup is shown which lets one choose between various accented forms of the character. To disable this execute the following command line in the Terminal.app:

```
defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false
```

> Now, you'll need to log out and log back in. This should disable the display of the popup and character typed should start repeating when the key is held down.

> If you ever wish to return to this behaviour, execute the following command line in the Terminal.app:

```
defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool true
```

> You'll need to log out and log back in again for the setting to take effect.
