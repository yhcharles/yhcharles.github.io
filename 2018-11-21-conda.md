key takeaways:

- Conda manage environments and packages
- An environment is a directory which consists of multiple packages, and isolated with other environments.
- Python itself is a package, so you can have different environments to use different versions of Python
- To manage environments:
  - list: `conda env list` or `conda info --env` or `conda info -e`
  - create: `conda create --name py2 python=2.7`
  - activate: `conda activate py2`
  - deactivate: `conda deactivate`
  - remove: `conda env remove -n py2`
- To manage packages in current environment:
  - list: `conda list`
  - install: `conda install PACKAGE=VERSION`
  - update: `conda update PACKAGE` or `conda upgrade PACKAGE`
  - uninstall: `conda uninstall PACKAGE` or `conda remove PACKAGE`
- Help: `conda -h`, or `conda SUBCOMMAND -h`
