# 2025-01-29 Date time format

{% embed url="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339.html" %}

We often see different date time represented in different format. The above doc is an RFC specifying the details.

Here are a few examples:

* `2025-01-29T09:00:00Z` there is a letter `T` between date and time, the letter `Z` stands for UTC time with no offset
* `2025-01-29T10:00:00+01:00` is actually the same time as above, but with 1 hour offset ahead of UTC time
