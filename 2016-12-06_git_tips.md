# 2016-12-06 git tips

Memo of some git tips.

## Normal case

Say you clone a remote repo to your local working environment. Then you start to make some changes to implement a new feature. You may want to create a local branch in order not to mess the `master` brach:

```sh
git co -b dev
```

Then you make some changes, and commit them:

```sh
git add -u
git ci -m 'xxx'
```

After a few commits, you've done with your new feature. Now you want to merge your change back to `master`:

```sh
git co master
git pull
git merge dev
```

That's all.

## Merge without commit history

Say you don't want to merge your commit history in `dev` to `master`, because that might make the log too tedious. Then you can use:

```sh
git merge --squash dev
```

This will *squash* your multiple commits as one into `master`.

## Merge without auto-commit

Usually, `git merge` automatically merge your change and commit it. But if you want to double check before commit:

```sh
git merge --no-commit dev
```

## Things messed up

If you got the `master` messed up, no worries, you can reset it:

```sh
git reset --hard origin/master
```

Then you have a clean `master` the same as `origin/master`. Now you can do `git merge` again.
