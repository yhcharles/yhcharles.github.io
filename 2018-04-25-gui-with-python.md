  - also check the issues in this project
- [remi](https://github.com/dddomodossola/remi)
  - with some built-in widgets, but seems not able to draw on canvas
- [pywebview](https://github.com/r0x0r/pywebview) ([js_api](https://github.com/r0x0r/pywebview/blob/master/examples/js_api.py))
  - integrate a webview in the app window, and interact with it, but in my test, sometimes the window just not show up
