# 2025-01-10 iTerm trigger

When running a command from terminal, sometimes I need to perform some actions based on the output text. For example, open a file from the traceback. Today I learned that this can be made easier by using iTerm2's triggers.

iTerm2's triggers allow you to perform automated actions based on the output in the terminal. For example, adding hyper link to a file, so you can click on it and open it in VSCode.
